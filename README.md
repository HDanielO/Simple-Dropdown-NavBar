## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

During this challenge, I was able to learn alot about layout and how to use DOM to make my site more interactive.

I was impressed with this particulaly;

```js
function Menu() {
  nav.classList.toggle("show_menu");
}
```

### Continued development

I actually did this challenge a month ago, I just decided to push it to github...just for practise reallyðŸ¤“
